# Self Evaluation

- How confident do you feel about your use of built-in Ruby methods?

I feel fairly confident with using the built-in Ruby methods.

- How confident do you feel writing simple methods of your own?

I feel fairly confident with creating and calling my own simple methods.

- What questions do you have about methods, and what they are capable of? (ask a question!!!)

Im having trouble with methods and scopes with variable created within methods. Is there a better way to access local variables or variable outside of scope without turning them global?
